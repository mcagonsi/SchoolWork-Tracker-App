# Bug Report: Session Persistence Issue

## Issue Description
The application fails to maintain user sessions when the page is reloaded. Users are being logged out and redirected to the login page whenever they refresh any page in the application.

## Current Implementation
- Using `sessionStorage` to store user authentication data
- Key session data stored:
  ```javascript
  sessionStorage.setItem('studentId', studentId);
  sessionStorage.setItem('userId', userId);
  ```
- Session data is set in LoginPage.js after successful login
- Other components (TaskDashboard, Profile, TaskTabs) rely on this session data

## Root Cause
1. `sessionStorage` is cleared when the browser tab/window is closed
2. No proper session validation mechanism in place
3. Session data is not being properly synchronized between components
4. No persistent storage mechanism being used

## Impact
1. Poor user experience due to frequent session losses
2. Users need to log in again after page refreshes
3. Work in progress may be lost when session expires
4. Increased server load due to frequent re-authentication

## Priority
High - This issue significantly impacts user experience and should be addressed in the next sprint.

## Status
Open - Issue reported and verified
